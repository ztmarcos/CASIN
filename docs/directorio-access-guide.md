http://localhost:5173/directorio-standalone
```

### Option B: Create Custom Bookmark

## Security Considerations

### Current Setup:

- ‚úÖ Users must be logged in to access any version
- ‚úÖ Same backend API security applies to all versions
- ‚úÖ No additional permissions needed

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Role-based access** - Different permissions for different user types
2. **API rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of edit operations
3. **Audit logging** - Track who makes changes
4. **Field-level permissions** - Control which fields users can edit

---

## Implementation for Your Use Case

### For Basic Users Who Need to Edit Contacts:

1. **Share the Simple URL:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/directorio-simple
   ```

2. **Create a Desktop Shortcut:**
   - Right-click on desktop
   - Create shortcut to the URL above
   - Name it "Contact Directory"

3. **Training Points:**
   - Show how to search for contacts
   - Demonstrate edit process
   - Explain status meanings (Client/Prospect/Inactive)
   - Show how to add new contacts

### For Advanced Users:
- Continue using main directorio: `http://localhost:5173/directorio`

---

## Customization Options

### Easy Customizations:
1. **Change page title** in DirectorioSimple.jsx
2. **Modify color scheme** in DirectorioSimple.css
3. **Adjust permissions** by modifying button visibility

### Advanced Customizations:

2. **Add approval workflow** for contact changes
3. **Integrate with external systems**
4. **Add custom validation rules**

---

## Backend API Endpoints Used

All versions use the same secure API endpoints:
- `GET /api/directorio` - List contacts
- `POST /api/directorio` - Create contact
- `PUT /api/directorio/:id` - Update contact
- `DELETE /api/directorio/:id` - Delete contact

**Note:** The same security and validation rules apply regardless of which interface is used.

## Troubleshooting

### If users can't access:
1. Verify they're logged in to the system
2. Check if the server is running on port 3001 (backend)
3. Verify frontend is running on port 5173
4. Clear browser cache and cookies

### If editing doesn't work:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify API endpoints are responding
3. Check database connection
4. Ensure user has proper permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Test the simplified version** at `/directorio-simple`
2. **Share URL with your users** who need edit access
3. **Collect feedback** on the simplified interface
4. **Customize styling** if needed to match your branding
5. **Consider role-based permissions** for enhanced security

The simplified directorio provides a clean, focused interface for users who primarily need to view and edit contact information without the complexity of the full CRM system.
